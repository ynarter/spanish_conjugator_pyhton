# Spanish Verb Conjugator in Pyhton

📚 Using the "conjugator_module.py" module I created which includes different functions that conjugate different tenses, the main script "conjugator.py" asks for the user for a verb and displays the conjugated form for all persons and tenses.

🧐 Feel free take help from this tool if you're a beginner in Spanish grammar.

⚠️ **Note that the code works only for regular verbs!**
