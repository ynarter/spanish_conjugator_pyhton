# Spanish Verb Conjugator in Pyhton

Using the "spanish_conjugator" module which includes different functions that conjugate different tenses, the main script "conjugator.py" asks for the user for a verb and displays the conjugated form for all persons and tenses. **Note that the code works only for regular verbs!**
